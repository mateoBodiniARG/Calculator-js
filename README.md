# Simple Calculator

I have created a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator performs basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Functionality

The calculator has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. Users can input numbers and perform mathematical operations with them. The results are shown in real-time on the calculator's screen.

In addition, I have added some additional features to the calculator, such as the ability to clear the screen, the option to use decimals, and the ability to perform consecutive operations without having to press the equal button each time.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## What's Next?

I am constantly seeking new challenges and creating projects every day to improve my programming skills. In the future, I plan to add more functionality to this calculator and also create more interesting projects with different technologies and tools.

Feel free to explore the source code of the calculator and leave any comments or suggestions you may have. I am always looking to learn and improve!
